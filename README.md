# trip-planner
A program to help you plan a road trip. 


locations.txt is a text file of all of the locations that you want to go to

like this:

Clemson, SC

Aiken, SC

Ft. Lauderdale, FL

It is okay to keep spaces and capitalization but they should not matter

weights.txt is the rating 1-10 that you want to go to every location
the point of this file is that, if you don't have enough time to visit all locations, the program uses this to find a route that still gives you the best experience.
